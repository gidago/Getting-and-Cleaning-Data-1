# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Data Source

The data linked to from the project represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Running Analysis

run_analysis.R that does the following. 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
